# Multi-Class-Discrimination-Models
This project contains implementations of three classic machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition:

1. **Perceptron Algorithm**

   * Applied to linearly separable class pairs (e.g., ω₁ vs ω₂ and ω₃ vs ω₂)
   * Iterative training and analysis of convergence behavior

2. **Least Squares (LS) Classifier**

   * Implemented for binary classification using class pairs
   * Comparison with the Perceptron approach in terms of training behavior

3. **Multi-class Logistic Discrimination**

   * Applied to all four categories using one-vs-rest and one-vs-one strategies
   * Identification of ambiguous classification regions

The goal is to compare the behavior, accuracy, and convergence of different linear classifiers on synthetic datasets. Visualizations and interpretation of decision boundaries are included.
